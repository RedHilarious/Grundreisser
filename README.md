# Grundreisser

Grundreisser is a floor and furnishing planner developed by a group Elizabeth Schnei√ü, Jonas Theis and Rahel Habacker during our studies at the RheinMain University of Applied Sciences. The development took place in a fourth semester course called Software Engineering lectured by Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Weitz in Winter 2014.

Basically there are two modes provided, construction and furnish mode. In the first one, walls can be build, windows and doors may be placed in an existing wall. To close a wall just click double. To swith in furnish mode, a room has to be closed. In this second mode, all items of construction can't be edited anymore.
Drafts can be saved or imported into Grundreisser.
